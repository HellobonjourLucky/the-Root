# the-Root


This generative coding project is a map
showing Kimâ€™s **root journey which is
always moving, growing, and radiating.**
These generative lines display that each
of her journeys has an influence on the
next journey. And her every journey is
connected with a close relationship with
each other, like a ripple in an ocean.

And the users can control the size of
waves with mouse moves. Despite the
differences in wave sizes, all waves
are organically, socially, and culturally
connected. So it makes the ripple
unique, and original and keeps moving.
